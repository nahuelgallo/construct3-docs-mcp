# Shadow caster behavior

# Shadow caster behavior

The Shadow caster behavior marks an object as casting a shadow from a Shadow light object. For more information, see the documentation for Shadow light.

Shadows are cast from the object's collision polygon, if it has one, otherwise its bounding rectangle.

### Scripting

When using JavaScript or TypeScript coding, the features of this behavior can be accessed via the IShadowCasterBehaviorInstance script interface.

[]()

## Collision polygon shape

Objects with the Shadow caster behavior must use convex collision polygons. Shadows will not render correctly if they use concave polygons. If you need a concave shape, this can always be achieved by placing multiple shadow caster objects next to each other to compose a concave shape out of convex parts.

[]()

## Shadow caster properties

Height
The simulated height of the object, which adjusts the length of shadow it casts. If the
*Shadow light*
height is less than or equal to the object height, it casts an "infinite" shadow which goes all the way offscreen; if it is higher, it uses the relative heights to calculate how long a shadow to cast. For example two objects with different heights will cast different length shadows.
Tag
A tag for this shadow casting object. A
*Shadow light*
object also has a tag, and can be set to only cast shadows from shadow casters with the same or different tags to itself. This can be used to have different
*Shadow lights*
casting shadows off different sets of objects, such as to have shadows working at different levels of Z order.
Enabled
Whether the behavior is initially enabled or disabled. If disabled, the object will not cast a shadow.
[]()

## Shadow caster conditions

Compare height
Compare the current height property of the behavior to a value.
Is enabled
True if the behavior is currently enabled so it can cast shadows.
[]()

## Shadow caster actions

Set enabled
Enable or disable the behavior. If disabled, the object will not cast a shadow.
Set height
Set the height property of the behavior. For more information see
*Shadow caster properties*
.
Set tag
Change the tag of the behavior. For more information see
*Shadow caster properties*
.
[]()

## Shadow caster expressions

Height
Return the current height property.
Tag
Return the currently set tag for the behavior.
