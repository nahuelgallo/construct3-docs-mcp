# Tween

# Tween

The Tween behavior animates the values of properties over time. For example you can "tween" an object's position to (100, 100), which will move it from its current position to the target position over time. Different ease functions can be used to alter the rate at which the value changes over time, for example using a Linear function for a constant-rate motion, In Out Sinusoidal for a sine-curve based movement which speeds up then slows down, and many more. Custom ease curves can also be designed with the Ease editor.

The term "tween" comes from the term "Inbetweening", referring to generating intermediate frames in between two states.

Tweening to a position moves objects over a fixed time. If you need to move objects to a position using a maximum speed with acceleration and deceleration, use the
[Move To behavior](https://www.construct.net/en/make-games/manuals/construct-3/behavior-reference/move)
instead.

### Scripting

When using JavaScript or TypeScript coding, the features of this behavior can be accessed via the ITweenBehaviorInstance script interface.

## Tween types

Construct's Tween behavior has three types of tween:

1. One-property tween, affecting only a single value, e.g. the X co-ordinate or the angle
2. Two-property tween, affecting a pair of values, e.g. the position (X and Y co-ordinates), size (width and height) or the scale (a percentage of real size)
3. Three-property tween, affecting a triad of values, e.g. the position (X, Y and Z co-ordinates)
4. Value tween, which just tweens a number rather than affecting a property. This can be used to apply the tween to anything else in events, such as behavior properties or effect parameters. Value tweens must also specify the start value, since it cannot be taken from a property.

These types are used by the tween actions: Tween (one property), Tween (two properties), Tween (three properties) and Tween (value).

## Tagging

The Tween behavior can manage multiple tweens simultaneously. To help identify them separately, each tween can be given a tag, which is just a string of any name you like to identify the tween. The tag is optional and can be left empty if you don't need to modify or identify the tween at any point later on.

Tweens can also be given multiple tags, separated by spaces. This can be useful to group tweens together under a common tag while also providing a unique tag to target them individually.

Actions, conditions and expressions which expect tags as an argument will match any tweens which include all of the provided tags.

### Tagging examples

Given these tweens with these tags:

| Name | Tags |
| --- | --- |
| Tween1 | "common size width" |
| Tween2 | "common size height" |
| Tween3 | "common color" |

This will be the expected matches:

| Tag | Matches |
| --- | --- |
| "common" | All Tweens |
| "common size" | Tween1 and Tween2 |
| "common size width" | Tween1 |
| "color" | Tween3 |
| "width" | Tween1 |
| "size" | Tween1 and Tween2 |
| "common size width height" | No Tweens |

Also note:

- Actions using tags affect all matching tweens.
- In the case of conditions, all the matching tweens are evaluated and if any is true, then the condition will be fulfilled.
- In the case of expressions, the first matching tween will be the one used to get the value from.
- Tags are case insensitive. For example "mytag", "MyTag" and "MYTAG" are all the same as far as tweens are concerned.

Set end value

Tween (one property)
Start a tween for a single property.
*Tags*
are optional space-separated tags to identify the tween, and can be left blank if not used.
*Property*
chooses which property of the object to modify. The start value of the tween uses the current value of the property.
*End value*
specifies the value to tween to.
*Time is the duration of the tween in seconds. Ease*
specifies an ease function affecting the rate of change over time.
*Destroy on complete*
can be set to
*Yes*
to automatically destroy the instance when the tween finishes, useful for fade-out effects. Like
[timelines](https://www.construct.net/en/make-games/manuals/construct-3/project-primitives/timelines/timeline)
, a one property tween can be set to
*Loop*
and/or
*Ping Pong*
and given a
*Repeat count*
.

Pause and resume an existing tween matching all the given tags. Pausing a tween will stop it at its current progress, and resuming will continue from where it was paused.
Pause all
Resume all
Pause and resume all current tweens.
Stop
Stop a tween matching all the given tags. Stopping a tween permanently ends a tween - it cannot be resumed afterwards.

[]()

## Tween actions - setters

Set destroy on complete
Set all destroy on complete
Set ease
Set all eases
Set the
*Destroy on complete*
and
*Ease*
parameters specified in the
*Tween*
action for existing tweens matching all the given tags. The
*all*
variants modify all tweens regardless of tags.
Set playback rate
Set all playback rates
Set the playback rate of existing tweens matching all the given tags, or all tweens regardless of tags. A playback rate of 1 is normal speed, 0.5 half as fast, 2 twice as fast, and so on.
Set time
Set all times
Set the playback time in seconds of existing tweens matching all the given tags, or all tweens regardless of tags. For example setting a time of 1 will skip the tween to playing as if it was 1 second after the tween was started.
Set enabled
Enable or disable the entire behavior. If disabled, the behavior will not affect any properties or advance any tweens.

## Tween expressions

Note expressions can only return a single value. When specifying tags, expressions return the value for the first tween with all the given tags.

Progress(tag)
Return the progress of a tween by its tags in the range 0-1.
Tags
This expression can be used in the various triggers to get the tag string of the associated tween.
Time(tag)
Return the playback time of a tween by its tags, in seconds since the tween was started.
PlaybackRate(tag)
Return the playback rate of a tween by its tags.
Value(tag)
Return the current value of a value tween by its tags.
