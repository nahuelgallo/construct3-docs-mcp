# List

# List

The List object creates either a dropdown list or list box form control. A dropdown list only shows one item but can be expanded to show the full list; a list box shows multiple items at once. The image below shows a dropdown list on the left (which has been expanded), and a list box on the right.

List types

### Scripting

When using JavaScript or TypeScript coding, the features of this object can be accessed via the IListInstance script interface.

[]()

## Layering HTML objects

This object displays using a HTML element rather than drawing in to the canvas. This means its layering works differently to other objects. To learn more about how to layer HTML objects, see HTML layers.

## Styling lists

As List objects are HTML elements, their appearance can be customised using CSS (Cascading Style Sheets). The ID and Class properties can be used to identify the HTML element, and a CSS project file added to apply some styles to it.

## List properties

Items
A list of the initial items to display in the list, with one item per line. Click the button to the right of the property to open a multi-line text box in a dialog to edit this more conveniently. The property field cannot show line breaks,

so instead represents lines with the special
**\n**
escape sequence.
Tooltip
A tooltip that appears in most browsers if the user hovers the mouse over the button and waits. Leave blank for no tooltip.
Initially visibile
Whether or not the control is initially visible in the layout.
Enabled
Whether the control is initially enabled. If disabled, the control will appear greyed out and the selection cannot be modified.
Type
Choose between the
*List box*
and
*Dropdown list*
control styles. An image displaying the two types is shown above.
Multi-select
Allow more than one item to be selected when
*Type*
is
*List box*
. This has no effect for dropdown lists.
Auto font size
Automatically set the font-size property of the element according to the layout and layer scale. This will prevent the
*font-size*
CSS property being manually set with the
*Set CSS style*
action. Disable if you intend to use
*Set CSS style*
to adjust the
*font-size*
property.
ID
Optional
An optional
*id*
attribute for the element in the DOM (Document Object Model). This can be useful for CSS styling.
Class
Optional
An optional
*class*
attribute for the element in the DOM (Document Object Model). This can be useful for CSS styling.
