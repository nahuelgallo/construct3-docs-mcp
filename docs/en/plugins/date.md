# Date

# Date

The Date object provides a set of conditions and expressions for managing dates and times.

For an example of the Date object, open the Date & Time example.

### Scripting

This object has no script interface, because when using JavaScript or TypeScript coding you can use the browser built-in Date object.

## Timestamps

The Date object mostly works with timestamps. These are the number of milliseconds since January 1st 1970 (also known as the Unix epoch), and is not affected by timezones or leap seconds. This is a standard way to reliably refer to a specific point in time in software development, and is sometimes referred to as the Unix time.

A timestamp is just a number, which makes it easy to store them in existing variables or compare them as you would any other number. However it's difficult for humans to make sense of a timestamp since it's just a single large number. The Date object provides expressions to convert between timestamps and human-readable dates and times, and other related tools.

## Date & time parts

A timestamp consists of the following parts, all of which are also numbers, with the given ranges and start points as noted:

- Year: the full four-digit year, e.g. 2020
- Month: the zero-based calendar month, e.g. 0 for January, 5 for June
- Date: the calendar date, i.e. the day of the month, from 1-31
- Day: the zero-based week day from 0-6, starting with Sunday, e.g. 2 for Tuesday
- Hours: the hours of the time, 0-23
- Minutes: the minutes of the time, 0-59
- Seconds: the seconds of the time, 0-59
- Milliseconds: the milliseconds of the time, 0-999

## Date Conditions

Compare Timestamps
Compare two timestamps. Equal timestamps refer to the same time, and a timestamp that is less than another precedes it in time.
Compare Date Strings
Compare two date strings with each other. The date strings are converted to their equivalent numeric timestamp before the comparison.
Compare Timestamp parts
Compare two timestamp parts with each other. The possible parts are Year (4 digit), Month (0 - 11), Date (1 - 31), Day (0 - 6), Hours (0 - 23), Minutes (0 - 59), Seconds (0 - 59), and Milliseconds (0 - 999).
Compare date string parts
Compare two date string parts with each other, they are converted to their equivalent numeric timestamp before the comparison. The possible parts are Year (4 digit), Month (0 - 11), Date (1 - 31), Day (0 - 6), Hours (0 - 23), Minutes (0 - 59), Seconds (0 - 59), Milliseconds (0 - 999).

### Date Expressions

ToString(timeStamp)
Convert a timestamp to a string representation including both date and time.
ToDateString(timeStamp)
Convert a timestamp to a string showing the corresponding date.
ToTimeString(timeStamp)
Convert a timestamp to a string showing the corresponding time.
ToLocaleString(timeStamp)
Convert a timestamp to a localized string representation including both date and time.
ToLocaleDateString(timeStamp)
Convert a timestamp to a localized string showing the corresponding date.
ToLocaleTimeString(timeStamp)
Convert a timestamp to a localized string showing the corresponding time.
ToUTCString(timeStamp)
Convert a timestamp to a string representation including both date and time in universal time.
Parse(dateString)
Parse a date string into the corresponding numeric timestamp. For the supported string formats, refer to the
[MDN documentation for Date.parse()](https://www.construct.net/out?u=https%3a%2f%2fdeveloper.mozilla.org%2fen-US%2fdocs%2fWeb%2fJavaScript%2fReference%2fGlobal_Objects%2fDate%2fparse%23Date_Time_String_Format)
, which is the underlying method used by this expression.
ToTimerHours(milliseconds)
Convert milliseconds to the equivalent amount of hours as they would be shown in a timer.
ToTimerMinutes(milliseconds)
Convert milliseconds to the equivalent amount of minutes as they would be shown in a timer (0-59).
ToTimerSeconds(milliseconds)
Convert milliseconds to the equivalent amount of seconds as they would be shown in a timer (0-59).
ToTimerMilliseconds(milliseconds)
Convert milliseconds to the equivalent amount of milliseconds as they would be shown in a timer (0-999).
ToTotalHours(milliseconds)
Convert milliseconds to the equivalent amount of hours, which may be a fractional value.
ToTotalMinutes(milliseconds)
Convert milliseconds to the equivalent amount of minutes, which may be a fractional value.
ToTotalSeconds(milliseconds)
Convert milliseconds to the equivalent amount of seconds, which may be a fractional value.
